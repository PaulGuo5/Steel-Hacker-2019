# Steelhack2019
1. Team name and members:
- "Buddha-like Beasts"
- Ruochi Zhang/ Qi Lu/ Xiaoqian Xu/ Tianqi Zhang/ Zhehao Guo

2. Inspiration: 
- Health rate is an important index for assessing people's health condition. We implemented an application to monitor people's heartbeat rate all day.
- We found that Google home cannot support health care, and Fitbit cannot support data analysis. To tackle the drawbacks, we extended two features for each device.

3. What is does:
- The user who wears Fitbit will be monitored by our application and generate and analyze full dataset at the back-end. The user can get a health report every day by speaking to google home and the user can also send the report to the doctor or others through google home. Once an irregular heartbeat rate was found, the user will get the result in the report. Moreover, the user can check out the full report on the website(www.healthelf.net).

4. Challenges we ran into:
- It is not very easy to access the Google Home Mini to the mobile App.
- We finally use Google API to send the request to the Google Home Mini, which sends us responses. The approach is realize is far more challenge for us.
- We would like to run the code on Google Platform but we find difficulties to apply the APIs.
- It is very hard for us to launch the software we need on the Raspberry but we did not find a fair good way to solve. Thus, we abandon it.
- We want to push our result on the GitHub. At first, we wanted to use the platform provided by domain.com, but our data can’t connect to the website. So we used GitHub pages and hero to realize it.
- We wanted to let the electronic arm perform as the home appliance but it doesn’t have specialist USB tools to connect to the raspberry or our laptop. So we abandon it.
